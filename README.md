Hospital Ministry App created for the use of Hospital Ministers. 
* This App was created for the use of Hospital Ministers so that through the process of taking the Self-Assessment Survey Hospital Ministers would be more able to regulate levels of stress in five seperate catagories: Spiritual, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, and Professional. 
* Also, this App was created for the use of two sepeate screens:
- One screen leads to devotionals such as prayer and also links to different resouces such as the Bible.
- The other screen leads to a specific devotional that helps one to reflect on the acronym for C.O.P.E. (Christian Faith, Opportunity, Physical, and Emotional).
