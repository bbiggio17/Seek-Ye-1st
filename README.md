Hospital Ministry App created for the use of Hospital Ministers. 
* This App was created for the use of Hospital Ministers so that through the process of taking the Self-Assessment Survey Hospital Ministers would be more able to regulate levels of stress in five separate categories: Spiritual, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, and Professional. 
* Also, this App was created for the use of two separate screens:
- One screen leads to devotionals such as prayer and also links to different resources such as the Bible.
- The other screen leads to a specific devotional that helps one to reflect on the acronym for C.O.P.E. (Christian Faith, Opportunity, Physical, and Emotional).

This application uses many different view controllers. As seen below it uses many different view controllers like Image View Controllers, Web View Controllers, Table View Controllers, and many customized View Controllers for each specific view. 

The majority of this applications code is in the AssessmentTableViewController.m. This is where we implemented most of code to perform actions such as pulling up alerts, saving UserDefaults, and customizing our UISegments and our MyTableViewCell. We also implement our Survey responses to either be saved in the UserDefaults or to be saved as UINotification for later. 

Below we have three main directories:

* 1. Images.xcassets -> This directory holds all of the images used in the project. These images were provided by the client and the graphic designer. 
* 2. Base.lproj -> This directory has the layout of the storyboard of the Seek Ye 1st project. One can see each View within this directory.
* 3. en.lproj -> This directory only holds one main file called InfoPlist.strings.
